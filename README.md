# Key-ScanCode
Key ScanCode is a small gui utility to view the scan and virtual key codes<br />
of individual keys on a keyboard.<br />

I usually write all my scripts/programs 100% from scratch, but this project<br />
is a major alteration of the smaller ScanCode script found @<br />
https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/21105-crazy-scripting-scriptlet-to-find-scancode-of-a-key/<br />
by Skan (?). Nothing wrong with his script and he has a much more thorough script there, but<br />
I need something bigger than his smaller script and something smaller than his bigger one lol<br />

## Program Features
1. View scan and virtual key code information in hexidecimal format
	- displays key names: a,NumpadUp,F1,v etc...
	- displays key scan code: SC01E,SC048,SC03B,SC02F etc...
	- displays key virtual key code: VK0x41,VK0x26,VK0x70,VK0x56 etc...
2. Pause reading input
